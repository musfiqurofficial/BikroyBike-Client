        "detail": "The new TVS Apache RTR 160 4V comes with a somewhat new design and a completely redesigned head section. The DRLs of the headlights has been brought up with a facelift and has been separated from the headlight section. The headlight is an AHO LED unit with separate brows as the DRLs. The taillight has been kept somewhat the same, as it is quite noticeable. The indicators have also been kept the same. The icing on the cake is the new instrument cluster of the bike. This new instrument cluster allows the rider to connect their phone directly. This gives you a more personalized motorcycle. All the information, such as the ODO, average speed, top speed, mileage, and many more will be available to you at the click of a button. This allows the rider to have a better idea about what is going on with their bike.",
